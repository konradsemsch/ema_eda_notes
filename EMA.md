# Introduction

## Three laws of model explanation

1) **Prediction’s validation:** for every prediction of a model, one should be able to verify how strong is the evidence that supports the prediction.
   
2) **Prediction’s justification:** for every prediction of a model, one should be able to understand which variables affect the prediction and to what extent.
   
3) **Prediction’s speculation:** for every prediction of a model, one should be able to understand how the prediction would change if the values of the variables included in the model changed.

## Black-box vs. Glass-box (White-box) models

## Model-specific vs. Model-agnostic methods

# Baseline workflow

# EMA (Explanatory Model Analysis)

## Quantitative methods

### Global (model-based)

1) Model performance metrics

2) Feature importance

3) Partial dependence profiles

4) Local dependance and accumulated-local profiles

5) Residual-diagnostic plots

### Local (prediction-based)

#### SHAP

#### LIME
